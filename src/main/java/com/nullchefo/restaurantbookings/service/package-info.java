import org.springframework.lang.NonNullApi;

//
//The code you provided is a package declaration for a Java package named com.nullchefo.restaurantbookings.service.
// Additionally, it includes an annotation @NonNullApi from the Spring Framework's org.springframework.lang package.
//

//The @NonNullApi annotation is typically used in Spring Framework projects to indicate that the elements (methods, parameters, etc.)
// in the annotated package or class are designed to be non-null by default. It's part of Spring's efforts to support null-safety in the codebase.
//

//By using this annotation at the package level, it signals that the default behavior within this package
// is to treat parameters and return values as non-nullable unless explicitly marked otherwise.
// This can help improve code robustness by reducing the risk of null pointer exceptions.
//

//Keep in mind that the specific behavior and usage of annotations can depend on the version of the Spring Framework being used,
// so it's a good idea to refer to the documentation corresponding to the version of Spring in your project.
